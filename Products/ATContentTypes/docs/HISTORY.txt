1.0-devel
=====================

 * Changed the behavior of the date criteria to make the meaning of
   each field clearer.  Now queries like 'More than 2 weeks ago' can be used,
   and will behave as expected.  This causes some inconsistency in importing
   CMFTopics.  Queries that were of the form 'min' 'x days' 'ago' are now
   'less than x days ago' which is a min:max query with an upper limit of now.
   The same goes for 'max' 'x days' 'ahead', all other queries should be close
   to identical (modulo an earliestTime() where it makes sense).  The
   inconsistency shouldn't be too important as the CMF date criteria was
   entirely inscrutable.  Also changed some strings for criteria descriptions
   for consistency. Fixes bug #1181418 (http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1181418&group_id=55262&atid=645337).
   Thanks to Dean Jackson for filing this bug and devising a reasonably usable
   UI.

 * Made the portal_types criteria work properly with either Types or
   portal_types indexes.  Disabled types restrictions in TopicTool, now uses the
   new Plone 2.1 search blacklist for types (site_properties.unfriendly_types).
   This creates a plone 2.1 dependency, as does a change in the
   atct_subtopic_form which now uses a macro from plone 2.1.
   [alecm]

 * Reworked linked select lists for criteria to use custom XMLHTTPRequest code,
   contained in modifySelectList.js.  I will eventually turn this into an AT
   MasterSelectWidget for the master select of two linked select lists.
   [alecm]

 * Added and enabled configlet for Topics, and unit tests for the criteria.
   Fixed a persistency bug in TopicsTool, and a sort bug the in criteria
   listing.  Added Missing.MV as a possible false value for Boolean Criterion.
   [alecm]

 * Removed some configuration vars from config.py and the ZConfig schema.
   [tiran]

 * Moved external types from ATCT to the new ATCTAddons product.
   [tiran]

 * Remove path of filename from ATFile's title when upload a file using MS IE.
   [panjunyong]

 * Merged uiteam-plip73-sanitize-short-names from the old plone
   svn repos: diff https://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/ATContentTypes/branches/1.0@6168
   https://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/ATContentTypes/branches/uiteam-plip73-sanitize-short-names
   [tiran]

 * Added flag to determine whether an content object has undergone a successful
   initial edit.  Use this flag along with detection of default naming to
   rename object on inital edit.
   [alecm]

 * Merged the topic tool branch into 1.0 XXX: insert history here 
   [tiran]

 * Refactored ConstrainTypesMixin to support PLIP 78
    o DISABLED means use standard allowed types from portal_types
    o ENABLED means use restrictions set
    o ACQUIRE means use types from parent if parent is of same portal type,
      else same as ENABLED (doesn't make sense to inherit from any content type)
    o immediatelyAddableTypes field - for subset of allowed types to show in
      the "add" menu
    o turned off and removed disable constrain-types flag

 * Turn on TemplateMixin for everything - now directly supported in Plone
   via "display" menu

 * Merged plip #3 branch: auto ordering / sorting into the 1.0 branch.
   Features / Changes:
    * Added getObjPositioninParent and getObjSize as helper methods for
      the catalog based folder listing to all types
    * Added AutoSortSuppot and AutoOrderSupport to ATCT. AutoSortSupport is
      used for the catalog based folder listing and AutoOrderSupport also
      adds some auto ordering based on OrderedFolder
    * Subclass ATFolder from AutoOrderSupport+AutoSortSupport, ATBTreeFolder
      only from AutoSortSupport
   [tiran]

 * ATEvent: Removed end date and start date from searchable text.
   [tiran]

 * Implemented PLIP #2 of ATCT: using ZConfig to configure the types and
   features of ATContentTypes.
   [tiran]
   
 * Changed default output of Document, Event and News Item to text/x-safe-html.
   X-safe-html is using CMFDefault.utils.scrubHTML to remove harmful tags
   like script.
   [tiran]

 * Merged tiran-notypesdir-branch. It's renaming and moving lot's of modules
   around. All content types are in the content/ package, criteria were moved
   to criteria/, tools to tool/ and modules like history aware to lib/. Also
   all modules and packages were renamed to be lower case.
   [tiran]

 * Added history support ATEvent's text field just like Document and News Item.
   [tiran]

 * Updated README.txt and INSTALL.txt: new versions, update from ATCT 0.2 and
   some other informations.
   [tiran]

 * Changed permission of ATNewsItem.EditableBody() to ModifyPortalContent.
   [tiran]

 * Added some tabs to the ZMI view of the portal_atct tool: Overview, rescale
   migrate and recatalog. The usage of the external methods is deprecated in
   favor of the tool.
   [tiran]

 * Restored Plone 2.0.x compatibility.
   [dtremea]

 * Don't show PloneSite, TempFolder and criteria in constrain types list.
   [tiran]

 * Disabled validator for ATEvent's phone field. Some people have reported that
   they have issues because numbers and especially extensions are handle
   differently in every country. Also see [ 974102 ] Can't enter phone extension
   in phone number field.
   [tiran]

 * Added XXX report tool to ATCT. It's mostly a copy from the Zope3 XXX tools.
   Note: XXX is a marker to show "here is something" wrong. It's not porn. :)
   The tool also reports TODO and BBB (for backward compatibility).
   [tiran]

 * Fixed [ 1049018 ] url field on Link doesn't allow mailto. Also added an
   isMailto validator to validation and enhanced the isUrl validator to support
   more protocols.
   [tiran]

 * Fixed [ 1114696 ] use correct mimetype for reStructuredText and [ 1122135 ]
   ATCT edit not preserving text type selection, not ATCT bug be renaming
   text/restructured to text/x-rst.
   [tiran]

 * Fixed [ 1158950 ] ATTopic default view wrong. This fix needs also a svn up
   of CMFPlone 2.1.
   [tiran]

 * Moved external storage based variants for ATFile and ATImage to a seperate
   module. They won't make it in the official trunk unless the storage is
   working well and the types are tested.
   [tiran]

 * Added 'atct_album_view' and 'atct_album_image' templates based on the
   templates of CMFPhotoAlbum.
   [tiran]

 * Replaced the config vars for permissions with new permissions:

    o ModifyConstrainTypes for constrain types mixin
    o ModifyViewTemplate for template mixin
    o ViewHistory for history mixin
    o UploadViaURL for the new upload via url feature

   By default the permissions are restricted to manager only.
   [tiran]

 * Added new upload via url feature to upload a file or image using an url. The
   file is downloaded from the remote server using urllib2. Since this feature
   isn't finished it's not available by default.
   [tiran]

 * Implemented some very useful functions based on CMFPhoto code for ATImage.
   The new features are:

    o getting the exif informations from images using Gene Cash's exif lib
    o getting the image orientation from exif data (rotation and mirror)
    o Rotating and flipping images using the PIL library incl. a new tab

   The CMFPhoto exif and transform code was written by several ppl including
   Oliver Baltzer and me. I'm unable to determine the other coders. Please
   write me an email if you want credits for your great work!
   [tiran]

 * Refactored huge parts of the migration suite. More later
   [tiran]

 * Fixed [ 1026616 ] Actions aren't migrated. Actions are migrated from
   the cmf fti if an action with the id doesn't exist on the atct fti.
   [tiran]

 * Migrating filter content types, allowed content types and allow
   discussion from cmf fti to atct fti.
   [tiran]

 * Updated requirements to CMFQuickinstaller 1.5/cvs,
   [tiran]

 * Starting to remove the switch* and migrate* external methods.
   [tiran]

 * Fixed default view of ATFolder. Pointing to view again makes a loop and
   raises a hard to debug exception because TemplateMixin is trying to use
   itself as default view which doesn't work.
   [tiran]

 * FTests: install kupu and epoz when available. Moved function test suite to
   ftests/
   [tiran]

 * Fixed [ 1157812 ] ival/vcal action icons not available
   [tiran]

 * Fixed ATTopic to use atct_edit like all other ATCT types.
   [tiran]

 * Added ERRATA.txt which covers known issues.
   [tiran]

 * Added integration tests for discussions.
   [tiran]

 * Ported topic migration and criteria enhancements + additional criteria
   from ender topic branch. Thx to Alec Mitchell for his great work! The new
   criteria are: ATSelectionCriterion, ATDateRangeCriterion,
   ATReferenceCriterion and ATBooleanCriterion.
   [allecm, tiran]

 * Changed archetype names of criteria and removed the AT prefix.
   [tiran]

 * Added unit tests for criteria and ATTopic.
   [allecm, tiran]

 * Added translate tab when LinguaPlone is available at installation or
   reinstallation time.
   [tiran]

 * Added mini scale with 200x200.
   [tiran]

 * Added integration tests for view and edit templates.
   [tiran]

 * I made major changes to the unit test suite. Also I've added more field
   tests, some important interface tests and cleaner and better base classes
   for tests.
   [tiran]

 * prepare ATFolder for use with TemplateMixin, use generic /view instead of
   /folder_listing as default and immediate view.
   [yenzenz]

 * Changed the way ConstrainTypes gets mixed in: Now ATCT is always subclassing
   folders from the ConstrainTypes class and the schema is always in the folder
   schema. Before this change ppl couldn't rely on the api. When the feature
   is disabled the fields are not shown in the schema and the overwritten
   methods are using a "shortcut" to the default methods.
   [tiran]

 * Renamed some methods in the constrain mixin to start with _ct_ for a clean
   name space.
   [tiran]

 * Added a tag methods to NewsItem for its image. Also changed the caption from
   TextField to StringField since it should contain only a small sentence or
   similar. The caption is applied as title to the news item image.
   [tiran]

 * When running unit tests all features like constrain mixin and template
   mixin are forced to be enabled in order to keep the tests sane and to test
   all features under all circumstances
   [tiran]

 * Dismembered the big beast schemata.py in types/ and types/criteria. The
   schemata are in the same modules as the types.
   [tiran]

 * Added content module which contains all important classes.
   [tiran]

 * Replaced all "from foo import *" by explicit imports.
   [tiran]

 * Used some code from Ben's great Bricolite product to have an add permission
   per type. It allows fine granulated permission settings.
   [tiran]

 * Fixed bug [ 1154073 ] criterion_edit_form.cpt(.metadata) has no default
   action. The default action for the criterion edit form is save.
   [tiran]

 * Added portal_atct tool. The new tool will be used for the new topic features
   and for the plone control panel.
   [tiran]

 * Interface geddon: Merged all interfaces into a single file
   [tiran]

 * Merged limi's ui branch which adds a text field to ATEvent and an image plus
   image caption to ATNewsItem.
   [limi, tiran]

 * Added related items reference field to all types using Danny's reference
   browser widget. The ATReferenceBrowserWidget has to be available.
   http://svn.plone.org/archetypes/MoreFieldsAndWidgets/ATReferenceBrowserWidget
   [tiran]

 * Removed old debian/ directory. I don't maintain it any more so there is no
   reason of having it in the cvs
   [tiran]

 * Removed QuotaSupport.py. It should never be in the official tree of ATCT
   [tiran]

 * Introduced great chances in the migration system: The portal type names of
   the ATCT types are the same as the CMF types. CMF types will be renamed at
   install time.
   [tiran]

 * Introduced ZConfig based configuration. It will replace the customconfig.py
   file.
   [tiran]

0.2.0-rc5 - 2005-02-26
======================

 * Updated requirements to Zope 2.7.4+, Python 2.3.4+ and AT 1.3.2-rc1+
   [tiran]

 * Cleaned up the migration suite a little bit and enhanced the doc strings.
   [tiran]

 * Replaces the globalAllow hack by createTypeByName which doesn't make
   security checks like "is the type implicitly or explicitly addable in the
   folder". It shares the same codebase as the function from PloneUtilities
   I once wrote to unfuck the create member area method.
   [tiran]

 * Better traceback support inside the migration suite.
   [tiran]

 * Added knob to toggle the installation of LinguaPlone in ATCT install.
   [tiran]

 * Added explicit portal type name to all ATCT types.
   [tiran]

 * Renamed newTypeFor to _actc_newTypeFor. The former name was confusing
   people.
   [tiran]

 * Added feature to access the name of the last editor through IHistoryAware.
   [ctheune]

 * Fixed a bug in the migration walker. Empty folders aren't skipped any more.
   [panjunyong]

 * Increase debugging in Migration suite to find issues with missing types in
   globalAllow.
   [tiran]

 * Ported atct_topic_view icon fix from HEAD.
   [tiran]

 * Don't create ATDocuments when uploading .pdf and .doc files
   [batlogg]

 * Resurrected warning message when we hit a broken object in the folder
   migration.
   [tiran]

 * Local roles and Creator are kept when migration.
   [panjunyong]

 * Update requirements to the soon to release AT 1.3.2 version and svn.
   [tiran]

 * Added update_data and manage_edit compat. methods to ATFile and ATImage.
   [tiran]

 * Added temporary fix for [ 1095242 ] EditableBody in ATNewsItem requires
   Modify portal content. It will stay in ATNewsItem until Plone is fixed.
   [tiran]

 * Fixed [ 1075193 ] infinite recursion in ATEvent. The __cmp__ hook was fixed
   a while ago but I forgot to mention it here.
   [tiran]

 * Fixed [ 1098347 ] validate_add_criterion.vpy has errors. The file was dos
   encoded
   [tiran]

 * Applied patch from [ 1104069 ] ATCT migration -- more ordering issues
   which fixes some more ordering issues
   [hahnfeld]

 * atct_topic_view now doesn't call getObject() anymore and is a small
   bit more performant. This also takes some burden from waking up objects.
   (Bug 1079030)
   [ctheune]

 * Made HTML the default content type for documents (and news items).
 * [ctheune]

 * Fixed [ 1080729 ] Wrong permissions for ATDocument.EditableText / setFormat
   [tiran]

 * Use StdoutStringIO in migration to be more verbose

 * Fixed atct_topcic_view: Make sure there is an object before referencing
   attributes. This can typically happen if there are problems with the
   AccessContentsInfo permission.
   [tesdal]

 * Removed support of Python 2.1 and 2.2 from INSTALL.txt. Some code like
   migration requires new features of Python 2.3 like generators.
   [tiran]

 * Added note to INSTALL.txt that ATCT will soon drop support for Zope < 2.7.2.
   [tiran]


0.2.0-rc4 - 2004-11-30
======================

 * ATTopic: Adding the criterion type to the generated id, so you can sort and
   filter on the same field.
   [ctheune]

 * Fixed unit tests to work without (and hopefully with too) runner again
   [ctheune]

 * Added feature that doesn't show users non-sortable criterions in the form
   [ctheune]

 * Added feature that removes double or stupid criterions (allowedRolesAndUsers,
   id/getId)
   [ctheune]

 * Sorting criterion lists (by their translations)
   [ctheune]

 * Added german translation
   [ctheune]

 * More i18n support in the templates
   [ctheune]

 * Fixed _very_ annoying problem with bad ids. this should be bullet proof.
   [ctheune]

 * Extended german translations
   [ctheune]

 * Fixed ATDocument to not kill uploaded files on the submission of an empty
   text area
   [ctheune]

 * Fixed small bug in id protection
   [ctheune]

 * Fixed the case where the portal doesn't has a 'Members' folder or
   when it has another name.
   [dtremea]

 * Fixed [ 1055347 ] id problems when member preferences are set to not display
   and [ 1055348 ] ATCTFile id problems with portal_factory in ATCTFileContent.
   _setATCTFileContent()
   [tiran]

 * Disabled external storages based types because neither I nor MrTopf have time
   to support it right now.
   [tiran]

 * Added long description field and image tag to ATImage. Fixed [ 1056050 ] Add
   longdesc to ATImage.
   [tiran]

 * Fixed [ 1057691 ] Make ATContentTypes tests works with testrunner.py. Thx to
   dan_t.
   [dan_t, tiran]

 * Added fix for [ 1063549 ] ATCT migration doesn't migrate order to migrator.py
   [tiran]

 * Fixed [ 1067719 ] Install.py bug: property modified but not assigned by
   removing unnecessary code from Install.py. AT itself is already handling
   use_folder_tabs.
   [tiran]

0.2.0-rc3 - 2004-10-17
======================

 * Added ATContentTypes Site customization policy
   [tiran]

 * Fixed [ 1041830 ] TypeError: cmf_edit() takes at least 3 non-keyword
   arguments by changing the edit() implementation. A class var named
   cmf_edit_kws was introduced to fix the issue.
   [tiran]

 * ATLink: Use urlparse library to sanify the url to strip of additional
   slashes. This is fixing http://plone.org/collector/3296 for ATCT.
   [tiran]

 * Added support for the clear format feature of CMF Document.
   [tiran]

0.2.0-rc2 - 2004-10-06
======================

 * Fixed problem with isIDAutoGenerated if the object was not wrapped in a site
   [tiran]

 * Fixed download tab [tiran]

 * Made image/file viewable when invoked directly by adding an index_html
   [tiran]

 * Replaced tag method of ATImage [tiran]

 * Fixed migration: Migration failed when there was a broken object in a folder
  [tiran]

 * Fixed property migration: continue if the object already has this attribut
   [tiran]

 * Added talkback discussion migration
   [tiran]

 * Set description as primary field for ATEvent. Also use an easier syntax for
   setting description to isMetadata = False.
   [tiran]

 * Renamed tab from history to last changes. Added big warning that the history
   is based on zodb revisions.
   [tiran]

 * Added ExtendingType howto (more to follow)
   [tiran]

 * Recoded migration walkers to use a generator instead returning a list to
   make them much more memory efficient.
   [tiran]

 * Rewritten folder migration to use the depth inside the folder structur
   instead of recursing into the full side.
   [tiran]

 * Added a findStaledObjects external method to ATCT to find staled objects. It
   is very useful to clean up a site before running the migration.
   [tiran]

 * Fixed an ugly bug in ATDocument which was screwing up references on copy.
   [tiran]

 * Merged ConstrainTypesMixin from the branch into the HEAD. Thx to Leonardo
   Rochael Almeida and Jens Werner Klein for their work.
   [yenzens, rochael]

 * Fixed [ 1013853 ] File upload image shows mime-type in widget
   [tiran]

 * Removed call to markCreationFlag()
   [tiran]

 * Fixed problem with ATFavorite: Migration to ATFavorite failed when the object
   was gone or the user wasn't allowed to access it.
   [tiran]

 * Fixed [ 1027070 ] Download permission. Now the download tab is shown for all
   logged in users with View permission.
   [tiran]

 * Fixed [ 1027093 ] Edit permission topics. The edit action of ATTopic now
   requires ChangeTopic permission.
   [tiran]

 * Fixed [ 1027094 ] folderlisting action for ATTopic. Removed folderlisting
   action using a module level modify_fti function in ATTopic.py.
   [tiran]

 * Fixed [ 1026379 ] ATDocument: skipField in setContentType throws error by
   removing the custom setContentType method. It's not required any more.
   [tiran]

 * Use a copy of the ATContentTypeSchema for every schema to make customizations
   easier. Fixed [ 1027283 ] Schema editing very hard.
   [tiran]

 * Fixed [ 1035380 ] Problems with createMemberArea and ATCT by adding a
   setFormat() method to ATDocument which is using the translate method to
   map between stupid CMF content types and real mime types.
   [tiran]

 * Changed mx.Tidy test to work around [ 1033396 ] Error on refresh.
   [tiran]

 * Fixed [ 1036267 ] Some typos in customconfig.py
   [tiran]

 * Fixed [ 1036255 ] switchCMF2ATCT: Favorite can't be added anymore. The type
   was disabled inside the switch script.
   [tiran]

 * Fixed [ 1027108 ] Inherit criteria not working
   [tiran]

 * Fixed [ 1030660 ] ConstrainMixin: All types are addable in an ATFolder by
   using a default_method to initialize the list of addable types. The method
   _globalAddableTypeIds was added to generate the list.
   [tiran]

 * Fixed a possible problem in allowedContentTypes: Now the method is using
   fti.isConstructionAllowed(context) to verify that the type is constructable.
   [tiran]

 * Added an option called enableConstrainMixin which is a boolean value
   (checkbox). When set to false the constrain mixin is disabled and the default
   list of addable types is generated by using the default values from
   portal_types.
   [tiran]

 * Fixed [ 1030662 ] ConstrainMixin: Can't add an ATTopic to portal root by not
   subclassing ConstrainTypesMixin for ATCTFolder. ATCTFolder must ONLY to used
   as a base class for folderish but non folder types.
   [tiran]

 * Added max_depth workaround and logging for [ 1039846 ] Ghosts in catalog
   while migration and endless loop
   [tiran]

0.2.0-rc1 - 2004-07-28
======================

 * Removed 'contents' tab and 'add new item' menu from ATTopic [gotcha]

 * Changed criteria tab to table UI [gotcha]

 * Added message when clicking remove on criteria without selecting first
   [gotcha]

 * Depend on new AT 1.3.0-beta3 release [tiran]

 * Changed ZMI add name of topic related types to 'ATContentTypes Topic' [tiran]

0.2-beta8 - 2004-07-21

 * Fixed validation problem with mx tidy validator and file uploads
   [tiran]

 * Changed time range ints in FriendlyDateCriterion to strings [tiran]

   ATImage [tiran].

0.2-beta7 - 2004-06-27

 * Moved around some code from ATFolder to ATContentType [tiran]

 * Fixed problem with index_html in ATBTreeFolder [tiran]

 * Fixed wrong portal type in Members ATBTreeFolder after migration [tiran]

 * Added initializeArchetype() to ATContentType base class and changed it to
   use edit() instead of update() to make invokeFactory compatible with the old
   cmf types syntax.

 * Fixed problem with _getPortalTypeName in initializeArchetype() phase of
   object creation. Before the fix the portal type name was the original type
   name (e.g. ATDocument) because it was changed after the initializeArchetype
   call by the portal types tool. This issue has caused some wired problems with
   LinguaPlone and workflows. [tiran]

 * ATFile file field and ATImage image field are now language independend.
   Later I will add a I18NImage and I18NFile if needed. Having a seperate type
   for language dependend content for file and image is in my opinion easier to
   understand for people. Besides it's like Zope3. [tiran]

 * Removed TemplateMixin specific code from ATContentType base class. It was
   moved to TemplateMixin some time ago. [tiran]

 * Better error reporting for migration errors [tiran]

 * Fixed migration problem when LinguaPlone was installed [tiran]

 * Added - as valid char for ids [tiran]

 * Reindex only Type, portal_type and meta_type in switching script [tiran]

 * Wrapped field tests in a portal to fix a problem with missing tools [tiran]

 * Fixed migration problem of modified date and created date and also fixed
   a problem with the unit test that was testing the right date. I was
   trying to compare the mod date after editing the objects. %-) [tiran]

 * Default type of ATDocument and ATNewsItem is configurable in customconfig.py
   [tiran]

 * Fixed issues with content type registry and registered templates after
   switching from or to ATCT mode. [tiran]

 * Added validation to ATEvent: end date must be after start date [tiran]

 * First release with all unit tests of Archetypes, ATCT and CMFPlone
   tiran-atct-integration branch passing!

0.2-beta6 - 2004-06-20

 * Fixed security of HistoryAwareMixin [tiran]

 * Added iCal/vCal export to AT Event [tiran]

 * Added LinguaPlone support [gotcha]

   rendering of TAL inside the body text.
   [tiran]

 * Moved AT Dyn Document to a new product [tiran]

 * Fixed the migration [tiran]

 * Fixed and improved the switch from/to "ATCT as default types" methods [tiran]

 * Updated docs [tiran]

 * Moved helper methods to utils [tiran]

 * Switch objects in content_type_registry, too [lelit]

 * Added isSwitchedToATCT method [tiran]

 * Fixed misc UI problems like doubled folderContents [tiran]

0.2-beta3 - 2004-04-20
