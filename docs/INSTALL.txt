=====================
Optional Requirements
=====================

mxTidy
------

Install egenix mxTidy to enable the validation of the body text of ATDocument.
The text is checked and is rejected if it contains wrong xhtml syntax that may
break the user interface of plone. 
You can download mxTidy from http://www.egenix.com/files/python/mxTidy.htm

PortalTransforms helper applications
------------------------------------

You should install all helpers application for PortalTransforms.
For debian users:
apt-get install lynx pdftohtml wv xsltproc tidy \
                unrtf ppthtml xlhtml gs-common xpdf-utils catdoc

Python Imaging Library (PIL) 1.1.5+
-----------------------------------

In order to enable the auto resizing feature of ATImage (Archetypes ImageField)
you have to install PIL also known as python-imaging or Python Imaging Library.
It's available under http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/

=======================
Reconfiguration of Zope
=======================

You need to reconfigure Zope to make it play nice with Plone and AT Content
Types.

At first you need to set reST header level to 2. For Zope 2.8 change the 
etc/zope.conf and adjust the environment section in the config file:

<environment>
    STX_DEFAULT_LEVEL 2
</environment>

For Zope 2.7 you also must set the rest-input-encoding and rest-out-encoding
to the same encoding you are using as site-encoding for Plone. I suggest using
utf-8 everywhere.
